            Hi! I'm David! I'm an aspiring web developer with a background in <strong>graphic design</strong> and <strong>game development.</strong>  I also stream on Twitch in my spare
            time, where I work on <em>3D printing projects.</em> On this page you can learn more about me, where you can find my work, and how to contact
            me about these things! You can even look at <a href="#img-section">my face</a> if you want!
